# Iris-Classification

**Project Overview**

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species based on their physical characteristics. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and is widely used for pattern recognition and data analysis.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset includes three classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

**Modeling Approach**

The project explores multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines, to classify the iris species. The best-performing model is then chosen based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

**Results**

* Summarize the results of the model, including accuracy and other relevant metrics.
* The best model achieved an accuracy of 100% to 97% on the test dataset. The confusion matrix and classification report are provided in the results section.
